    "rationale": "Ensure that your Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues are protecting the contents of their messages using Server-Side Encryption (SSE). The SQS service uses an AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) to generate data keys required for the encryption/decryption process of SQS messages. There is no additional charge for using SQS Server-Side Encryption, however, there is a charge for using AWS KMS.",
