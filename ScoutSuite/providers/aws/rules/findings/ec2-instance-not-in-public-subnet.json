    "rationale": "Ensure that no backend EC2 instances are provisioned in public subnets in order to protect them from exposure to the Internet. In this context, backend instances are EC2 instances that do not require direct access to the public internet such as database, API or caching servers. As best practice, all EC2 instances that are not Internet-facing should run within a private subnet, behind a NAT gateway that allows downloading software updates and implementing security patches or accessing other AWS resources like SQS and SNS.",
