Security\nWhen S3 buckets are not configured to strictly require SSL connections, the communication between the clients (users, applications) and these buckets is vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Cloud Conformity strongly recommends enforcing SSL-only access by denying all regular, unencrypted HTTP requests to your buckets when dealing with sensitive or private data.",
