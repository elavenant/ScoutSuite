    "rationale": "Ensure that your Azure network security groups (NSGs) don't have range of ports configured to allow inbound traffic in order to protect associated virtual machine instances against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or brute-force attacks. To follow cloud security best practices, it is strongly recommended to open only specific ports within your NSGs, based on your application requirements.",
