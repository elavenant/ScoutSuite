    "description": "Enable Dual Identification for Password Reset",
    "rationale": "Enabling dual identification before allowing a password reset in your Azure Active Directory account enhances access security by ensuring that the user identity is confirmed by two separate forms of identification such as email and SMS. When the number of methods required to reset a user password is set to 2 (two), an attacker would need to compromise both the identity forms configured, before he or she could maliciously reset an Azure AD user password.",
