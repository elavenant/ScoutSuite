In this case, the condition used is 'Whenever the Policy Activity Log \"Create policy assignment (policyAssignments)\" has \"any\" level, with \"any\" status and event is initiated by \"any\"'.Monitoring your Azure cloud account for \"Create Policy Assignment\" events can provide insights into changes done within the \"Policy Assignment\" Azure policy and can help reduce the time it takes to detect unsolicited changes.",
